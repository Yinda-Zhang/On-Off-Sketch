# On-Off Sketch: A Fast and Accurate Sketch on Persistence

## Introduction

**On-Off sketch** is an algorithm that can address two typical problems about persistence â€“ **persistence estimation** and **finding persistent items**. For persistence estimation, utilizing the characteristic that the persistence of an item is increased periodically, we compress increments of multiple items mapped to the same counter, which significantly reduces the error. Compared with the Count-Min sketch, 1) in theory, we prove that the error of the On-Off sketch is always smaller; 2) in experiments, the On-Off sketch achieves around 6.17 times smaller error and 2.13 times higher throughput. For finding persistent items, based on our solution to persistence estimation, we separate persistent items and non-persistent items to further improve the accuracy. We show that the space complexity of our On-Off sketch is much better than the state-of-the-art (PIE), and it can reduce the error up to 4 orders of magnitude and achieves 3.58 times higher throughput than prior algorithms in experiments.

[*Our paper*](https://yindazhang.github.io/files/on-off-sketch.pdf) will appear in VLDB 2021.

## Repository structure

*  `common/`: the hash function and bitset data structure used by many algorithms
*  `PE/`: the implementation of algorithms on persistence estimation in our experiments
*  `FPI/`: the implementation of algorithms on finding persistent items in our experiments
*  `benchmark.h`: C++ header of some benchmarks about AAE, F1 Score, and throughput

## Requirements

- cmake
- g++

We conducted all experiments on a machine with one 6-core processors (6 threads, Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8400 CPU @ 2.80GHz) and 16 GB DRAM memory. Each processor has three levels of cache memory: one 32KB L1 data caches and one 32KB L1 instruction cache for each core, one 256KB L2 cache for each core, and one 9MB L3 cache shared by all cores.

## How to run

```bash
$ cmake .
$ make
$ ./bench your-dataset
```
